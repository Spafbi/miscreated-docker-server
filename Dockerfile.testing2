# This section is for configuring Wine overrides.
# Wine overrides are necessary to ensure that specific Windows DLLs or libraries are used instead of the default ones provided by Wine.
# This can help improve compatibility and stability for certain applications running in the Wine environment.
# By specifying overrides, we can address issues related to application behavior, performance, or graphical rendering.

# This Dockerfile exposes the necessary ports for the server to function correctly.
# Typically, game servers require multiple ports for different types of communication.
# For example:
# - Port 3389/TCP: Console access using a remote desktop connection (RDP) client.
# - Port 64090/UDP: Game server port for client connections.
# - Port 64091/UDP: Game server port for Steam query
# - Port 64092/UDP: Game server port for server info.
# - Port 64093/UDP: Game server port for VoIP.
# - Port 64094/TCP: Game server port for RCON.
# Ensure that these ports are correctly mapped in your Docker run command or Docker Compose file.
